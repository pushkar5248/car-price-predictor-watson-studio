# üöó Car Price Prediction using IBM Watson AutoAI

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on technical and performance specifications using **IBM Watson AutoAI**. The dataset includes a wide range of cars from different manufacturers with attributes like engine capacity, horsepower, acceleration, fuel type, torque, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Original CSV file had inconsistent formats (e.g., `Torque`, `Fuel Type`, etc.)
   - Cleaned and optimized using Python scripts (handled missing values, removed symbols like `Nm`, `/`, `+`, etc.)
   - Converted `Fuel_Type` from string codes (`P`, `D`, `H`, etc.) into numeric mappings
   - Final dataset had columns like:
     ```
     Company/Brand, Battery_CC, Battery_kWh, Horsepower (hp), Top Speed (km/h),
     Acceleration, Price ($), Fuel Type, Seats, Torque (Nm)
     ```
   - Had to take a bit of help from AI due to the dataset being too informal and inconsistent for direct use in ML training.

2. **Model Training**
   - IBM Watson AutoAI was used to automatically:
     - Analyze dataset
     - Select features
     - Run experiments
     - Build pipelines
     - Evaluate performance
   - Trained on 1000 random rows
   - Tested on remaining ~219 rows
   - Due to multiple experiments and tests, the default Watson runtime environment's CUH (Compute Unit Hours) ran out.
   - A second Watson runtime environment was created to continue the project with available CUH credits.

3. **Prediction and Evaluation**
   - Model deployed through AutoAI
   - Predictions extracted from JSON output
   - Evaluation done using:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - R¬≤ Score

## üß© Challenges Faced

- Inconsistent and messy data formats (e.g., `"100 - 140 Nm"`, `"800 Nm"`, `"GT Model"`, etc.)
- Missing values in numerical and categorical columns
- AutoAI model failure due to unsupported imputation on categorical missing values
- Limited CUH (Compute Units Hours) in IBM Watson Studio (only 0.08 left at one point)
- Created a second Watson runtime to overcome CUH exhaustion and continue experiments
- Manually preprocessed columns to make the dataset ML-ready
- Used AI assistance for cleaning, mapping, and restructuring columns for compatibility
